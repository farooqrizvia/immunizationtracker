## Short description

Platform to provide information whether a person is immunized or not.

### What's the problem?

With the COVID19 becoming a pandemic , it is important to track status of the immunizations of every individual across the world. This information is important to be tracked and maintained for people and agencies to track travel, health and other related sectors. 

### How can technology help?

The application provides a common platform for authorized healthcare providers and common man to be able to self register and provide the flexibility to track their immunization status. Technology enables easy access and maintainability of this information on a very large scale.
