# Immunization Tracker

As the new coronavirus continues to spread, people around the world are anxious to know when we might have a vaccine to stop it. A vaccine against COVID-19 would slow its spread around the world. Fewer people would get sick, and more lives could be saved. 
Our technology should provide platforms/solution to reach out people to tell whether they are immunized and also enable them to register for vaccination.
The goal is to get this app to the hands of many people as possible. To truly make a change, this API needs to be more exposed. Providing a set of open source tools, backed by IBM Cloud.

## Section 1

HealthCare Registraion: 
1>For this platform they can register themselves and add the resources from the health care organization to immunize people. In Order to have that control on who from the organization can go for the immunization and the invite can be send by using an email address. So the registration is not open for public to add health care resources. 
As a healthcare organization they can go and search for the self-registered user immunize them and also update the immunization status in the tool. So the immunization status is refl ected for the end user.
The healthcare agent can also search/view how many people they have immunized in a given date.
The functionality that has only been provided only for the health care admin is to able to see at an org level how much immunization happened over a period.


### Subsection 1.1

Self-Registration Process for End User: The other platform we are providing the self-registration so that manual documentation can be reduced. Any user who who wants to get the immunization done can self-register themselves.
This application is only confined for users in the India .So the key is to identify any user is Aadhar ID. There are cases where will not have Aadhar card  , we have provided an option to add dependents where a primary Aadhar card can  be associated to maximum of five people who donot have Aadhar card. Here the identity of the user can identified by any of KYC documents like voterId, passport and driving license etc,.,


## Conclusion

Once the person has done the self-registration, who can go to any health care organization get himself immunized. Only the health care organization have the option to mark whether person is immunized or not.
Further APIs can be provided to any application like for eg Aargoya setu App, this info can be integrated whether this person is immunized or not.
